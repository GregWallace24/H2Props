# H2Props
Tabulates properties of hydrogen (normal, para, ortho) above the triple point

The tables are put into a file, with the name depending on whether it is gas/liquid/supercrical, para/ortho/normal, and the temp and pressure ranges.

Tables for all 3 phases will always be generated, but some might be empty depending on the temp and pressure range used (as seen in the example tables).

I'm not much of a coder, so much of the code is written very linearly, with the intent that a non-coder (most engineers) can understand with only the basic syntax known.
